This is a separate parameter from `assets` since there can be some precision loss when calculating this,         which would lead to having dust in the pendingDepositRequest value and         never closing out the request even after it is technically fulfilled.         Example:         User deposits 100 units of the vaults underlying asset.         - At some point they make cancellation request. The order in which is not guaranteed         Both requests arrive at CentrifugeChain. If the cancellation is first then all of the         deposited amount will be cancelled.         - There is the case where the deposit event is first and it gets completely fulfilled then         No amount of the deposited asset will be cancelled.         - There is the case where partially the deposit request is fulfilled. Let's say 40 units.         Then the cancel request arrives.         The remaining amount of deposited funds which is 60 units will cancelled.         There is a scenario where the deposit funds might different from the pool currency so some         swapping might happen. Either during this swapping or some fee collection or rounding there will be         difference between the actual amount that will be returned to the user.         `fulfillment` in this case will be 60 units but assets will be some lower amount because of the         aforementioned reasons         Let's assume the `asset` is 59. The user will be able to take back these 59 but         in order to not let any dust, we use `fulfillment` in our calculations.         `pendingDepositRequest` not necessary gets zeroed during this cancellation event.         When CentrifugeChain process the cancel event on its side, part of the deposit might be fulfilled.         In such case the chain will send two messages, one `fulfillDepositRequest` and one         `fulfillCancelDepositRequest`. In the example above, given the 100 units         deposited, 40 units are fulfilled and 60 can be cancelled.         The two messages sent from CentrifugeChain are not guaranteed to arrive in order.         Assuming first is the `fulfillCancelDepositRequest` the `pendingDepositRequest` here will be reduced to         60 units only. Then the `fulfillCancelDepositRequest` arrives with `fulfillment` 60. This amount is         removed from `pendingDepositRequests`. Since there are not more pendingDepositRequest` the         `pendingCancelDepositRequest` gets deleted.         Assuming first the `fulfillCancelDepositRequest` arrives then the `pendingDepositRequest` will be 100.         `fulfillment` is 60 so we are left with `pendingDepositRequest` equals to 40 ( 100 - 60 ).         Then the second message arrives which is `fulfillDepositRequest`. ( Check `fulfillDepositRequest`         implementation for details.)         When it arrives the `pendingDepositRequest` is 40 and the assets is 40         so there are no more `pendingDepositRequest` and right there the `pendingCancelDepositRequest will be         deleted.\"},\"fulfillCancelRedeemRequest(uint64,bytes16,address,uint128,uint128)\":{\"details\":\"The shares in the escrow are reserved for the user and are transferred to the user during         claimCancelRedeemRequest calls.\"},\"fulfillDepositRequest(uint64,bytes16,address,uint128,uint128,uint128)\":{\"details\":\"The shares in the escrow are reserved for the user and are transferred to the user on deposit         and mint calls.\"},\"fulfillRedeemRequest(uint64,bytes16,address,uint128,uint128,uint128)\":{\"details\":\"The assets in the escrow are reserved for the user and are transferred to the user on redeem         and withdraw calls.\"},\"mint(address,uint256,address,address)\":{\"details\":\"The assets required to fulfill the mint are already locked in escrow upon calling requestDeposit.

This is a separate parameter from `assets` since there can be some precision loss when calculating this,         which would lead to having dust in the pendingDepositRequest value and         never closing out the request even after it is technically fulfilled.         Example:         User deposits 100 units of the vaults underlying asset.         - At some point they make cancellation request. The order in which is not guaranteed         Both requests arrive at CentrifugeChain. If the cancellation is first then all of the         deposited amount will be cancelled.         - There is the case where the deposit event is first and it gets completely fulfilled then         No amount of the deposited asset will be cancelled.         - There is the case where partially the deposit request is fulfilled. Let's say 40 units.         Then the cancel request arrives.         The remaining amount of deposited funds which is 60 units will cancelled.         There is a scenario where the deposit funds might different from the pool currency so some         swapping might happen. Either during this swapping or some fee collection or rounding there will be         difference between the actual amount that will be returned to the user.         `fulfillment` in this case will be 60 units but assets will be some lower amount because of the         aforementioned reasons         Let's assume the `asset` is 59. The user will be able to take back these 59 but         in order to not let any dust, we use `fulfillment` in our calculations.         `pendingDepositRequest` not necessary gets zeroed during this cancellation event.         When CentrifugeChain process the cancel event on its side, part of the deposit might be fulfilled.         In such case the chain will send two messages, one `fulfillDepositRequest` and one         `fulfillCancelDepositRequest`. In the example above, given the 100 units         deposited, 40 units are fulfilled and 60 can be cancelled.         The two messages sent from CentrifugeChain are not guaranteed to arrive in order.         Assuming first is the `fulfillCancelDepositRequest` the `pendingDepositRequest` here will be reduced to         60 units only. Then the `fulfillCancelDepositRequest` arrives with `fulfillment` 60. This amount is         removed from `pendingDepositRequests`. Since there are not more pendingDepositRequest` the         `pendingCancelDepositRequest` gets deleted.         Assuming first the `fulfillCancelDepositRequest` arrives then the `pendingDepositRequest` will be 100.         `fulfillment` is 60 so we are left with `pendingDepositRequest` equals to 40 ( 100 - 60 ).         Then the second message arrives which is `fulfillDepositRequest`. ( Check `fulfillDepositRequest`         implementation for details.)         When it arrives the `pendingDepositRequest` is 40 and the assets is 40         so there are no more `pendingDepositRequest` and right there the `pendingCancelDepositRequest will be         deleted."},"fulfillCancelRedeemRequest(uint64,bytes16,address,uint128,uint128)":{"details":"The shares in the escrow are reserved for the user and are transferred to the user during         claimCancelRedeemRequest calls."},"fulfillDepositRequest(uint64,bytes16,address,uint128,uint128,uint128)":{"details":"The shares in the escrow are reserved for the user and are transferred to the user on deposit         and mint calls."},"fulfillRedeemRequest(uint64,bytes16,address,uint128,uint128,uint128)":{"details":"The assets in the escrow are reserved for the user and are transferred to the user on redeem         and withdraw calls."},"mint(address,uint256,address,address)":{"details":"The assets required to fulfill the mint are already locked in escrow upon calling requestDeposit.
